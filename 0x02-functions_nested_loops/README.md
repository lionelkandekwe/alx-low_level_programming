Tasks

0. _putchar
1. a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. 10 x alphabet
3. islower
4. a function that checks for alphabetic character
5. Sign
6. a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7. a function that prints the last digit of a number.
8. a function that prints every minute of the day of JB, from 00:00 to 23:59
9. a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
10. a function that adds two integers and returns the result
11. a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98,  by a new line
12. a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0
13. a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded),  followed by a new line.
14. Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
15. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use the standard library
16. Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
